# Spanning trees generator
Generating all spanning trees of a connected, undirected graph using the contraction-deletion algorithm.

A spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph is a subgraph that is a tree and includes all of the vertices of the original graph. In other words, it is a subset of the original graph, which forms a tree that includes all the vertices of the original graph with a minimum possible number of edges.
